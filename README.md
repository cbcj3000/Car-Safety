# NYC Urban Traffic Safety & Risk Analytics
A comprehensive data analytics solution designed to visualize ten years of NYC collision data, utilizing Python for creating advanced statistical datasets and cleaning and Power BI for relational modeling, data visualization, and geospatial insights.

**Tech Stack**
- **Power BI**: Relational modeling, Data visualization, and Geospatial visualization
- **Python (Pandas/NumPy)**: Statistical data generation and automated Excel manipulation

**Key Features**

### Geospatial Zipcode and Heatmapping & Risk Assessment
- **Zip Code Choropleth**: Visualizes collision density across all 200+ NYC residential zip codes with realistic high-variance distribution.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Slicers for Boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) and Time (2000–Present).
- **Incident HeatMap**: Precise Latitude/Longitude plotting to identify high-risk urban corridors.

### Statistical Demographic Modeling
- **Bimodal Age Distribution**: Utilized Python-based probability weighting to simulate a realistic age "bell curve".
- **Outcome Analysis**: Dynamic "Outcome Ratio" tracking Injured vs. Killed vs. Property Damage Only (Others).
- **Victim Role Identification**: Segmentation by Bicyclist, Occupant, and Pedestrian roles.

### Advanced Temporal Analysis
- **10-Year Trend Tracking**: Data spans from 2016 through 2026 to allow for predictive trend analysis and historical benchmarking.
- **Custom Date Dimension**: Full calendar integration supporting Time Intelligence (YoY, Month-over-Month, Weekend vs. Weekday trends).
